title: Designing the Shooting Mechanism
---

## Adventures in CAD

Last night, we focused on finalizing the design for the shooting mechanism. We had a few requirements.

+ All actuation must be driven by servos
+ A single stroke must load the mechanism and fire it
+ The shot will be powered by elastic
+ The magazine will be gravity-powered
+ Must fit the dimensions of a Skittle

It took a lot of sketching and headaches to figure out the design, but here's what we conjured up:
