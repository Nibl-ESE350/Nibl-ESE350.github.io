Jason and I had to lift our shirts up during the demo in order for the heat-seaking to even work at a close range. Despite the sexy-factor, the teaching staff didn't love that. So, we are switching to processing camera images on a visual cue. We bought two bright, uniquely colored gift bags at CVS. We have nicknamed them Cosmo and Wanda. From some pictures of Cosmo and Wanda, we've figured out what ratios of RGB values identify the colors well. Using this information, we will process images to see how much Cosmo and Wanda they have, and find their "center of mass." 

The algorithm works pretty nicely!

![cosmo and wanda proc]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/test1proc.jpg "test1proc")
