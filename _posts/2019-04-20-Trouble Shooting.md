title: Trouble Shooting (Hah get it?)

## The print

Our prints came out pretty nice! Here's the loading mechanism, and the shooting mechanism, hand powered.

![shooter]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/shooter.gif "shooter gif")

![loader]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/loader.gif "loader gif")

The thing is, our motors don't have nearly enough torque to power these mechanisms. We'll have to see how to go forward.
